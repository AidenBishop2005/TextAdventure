The Last Hearth Tavern hummed with activity as a storm raged outside. You, a traveler seeking adventure, sat at a corner table, nursing a tankard of ale. A cloaked man entered, carrying a strange, glowing tablet.
He offered the artifact to the tavern, and you, drawn by the allure of adventure, stepped forward. The man warned you of the tablet's power and disappeared into the night.
You stared down at the table and saw some words start to appear of the surface of the stone.
